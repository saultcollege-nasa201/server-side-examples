# Simple Full-Stack Multi-Page Application

This server uses the Express library with an SQLite database to create a more typical multi-page application. It features a basic user management system and the ability for users to add content to the site using the site's interface.

## Setup

This application uses a number of modules not in base node, so you must first install those packages.  In a terminal...

```sh
cd simple-full-stack-mpa
npm install
```

## Run

Once you have installed all the node packages above, you can run the server using 

```sh
npm run start
```

Then in a browser, load the URL shown in the terminal.
