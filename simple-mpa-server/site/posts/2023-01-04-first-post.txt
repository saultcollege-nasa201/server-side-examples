# First Post

Hi there! This is my first post on my [blog](/). It uses a very simple dynamic Node JS server. Here's how it works:

- When the server receives a **request** for a path like '/' or '/posts/first-post' it looks for a txt file at that path
- If it finds one, it **loads** the file, then does some simple text processing to convert it into an HTML document
- It uses the HTML document as the **body** of the response
